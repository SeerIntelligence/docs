Our team of experts employs advanced techniques to assess the security posture of your applications, providing actionable insights to enhance your overall cybersecurity resilience.

## Purpose

Application security testing is crucial to ensuring that your software applications are robust, resilient, and resistant to potential cyber threats. Seer Intelligence's services aim to identify and address vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors, ultimately safeguarding your organization's sensitive data and digital assets.

## Methodology

Our approach to application security testing encompasses a thorough examination of various aspects, including:

- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Analyzing the application's source code to identify potential vulnerabilities without executing the program.

- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Assessing the application during runtime to identify vulnerabilities that may arise in real-world scenarios.

- **Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST):** Combining elements of both SAST and DAST to provide a comprehensive analysis of application security.

- **Manual Code Review:** In-depth manual examination of the code to identify complex vulnerabilities that automated tools may overlook.

## Deliverables

Upon completion of application security testing, clients receive a detailed report encompassing:

- **Vulnerability Assessment:** A comprehensive list of identified vulnerabilities with severity levels.
