# What is active defense




Active defense in cybersecurity refers to a proactive approach to protecting computer systems and networks. Unlike passive defense measures, which focus on detecting and responding to attacks after they have occurred, active defense involves actively engaging and disrupting cyber threats in real-time. The goal is to prevent or minimize the impact of cyber attacks by taking pre-emptive actions.

Here are some key aspects of active defense that SeerIntelligence offers:

1. **Threat Intelligence:** Actively gathering and analyzing information about potential threats and attackers. This includes monitoring online forums, analyzing malware, and staying informed about the latest cybersecurity trends.

2. **Incident Response:** Developing and implementing rapid response plans to address security incidents as soon as they are detected. This involves quickly isolating affected systems, analyzing the scope of the incident, and implementing countermeasures.

3. **Deception Technologies:** Deploying deceptive techniques, such as honeypots and honeynets, to mislead attackers and lure them into environments that simulate real systems. This allows security teams to study attackers' tactics, techniques, and procedures.

4. **Active Monitoring and Surveillance:** Continuously monitoring network traffic, system logs, and user activities to identify suspicious or malicious behavior. This includes using intrusion detection systems (IDS) and security information and event management (SIEM) tools.

5. **Countermeasures and Offensive Actions:** Taking active steps to disrupt or thwart cyber threats. This might involve blocking malicious IP addresses, disrupting communication channels, or actively engaging with attackers to gather intelligence.

6. **Collaboration and Information Sharing:** Actively participating in information-sharing networks and collaborating with other organizations, both within and across industries. Sharing threat intelligence can help organizations stay ahead of evolving cyber threats.

7. **Continuous Security Awareness Training:** Regularly educating and training employees on cybersecurity best practices to reduce the likelihood of falling victim to social engineering attacks and phishing attempts.

It's important to note that active defense should be conducted within the bounds of legal and ethical considerations. Offensive actions, such as hacking back or retaliatory measures, can have legal consequences and may not be universally accepted in the cybersecurity community. Organizations should carefully consider the potential risks and legal implications before implementing active defense strategies.
